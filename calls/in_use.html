						<h2>Call for In-Use Track</h2>
						<p>
							The IJCKG In-Use track provides a forum to explore the benefits and challenges of applying Knowledge Graph technologies in concrete, 
							practical use cases, in contexts ranging from industry to government and society (e.g., cultural heritage, astrophysics, biodiversity, medicine).</p>
						<p>
							The track aims to give a stage to applied works addressing real-world problems in which Knowledge Graph technologies have been employed, 
							possibly in combination with machine learning, deep learning, large language models, and other AI techniques.
						</p>
						<p>
							The In-Use track thus seeks submissions describing applied research as well as software tools, systems, 
							or architectures that benefit from the use of Knowledge Graph technologies. Importantly, submitted papers should provide convincing 
							evidence of the use of the proposed application or tool by the target user group, preferably outside the group that conducted the development and, 
							more broadly, outside the Knowledge Graph research communities.
						</p>
						<p>
							A primary focus of the submissions should be on the benefits of Knowledge Graph technologies for the intended use case and 
							(if relevant) the added challenges they introduce. In addition, papers that advance the understanding of issues related to applying 
							and deploying solutions involving Knowledge Graph technologies in practice are strongly encouraged.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</b>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Knowledge Graph Enhanced Large Language Models:</b>
									Knowledge Graph Enhanced Training, Knowledge Graph Enhanced Reasoning, Knowledge Graph Enhanced Interpretability</li>
								<li><b>Knowledge Representation and Reasoning:</b>
									Ontology Modeling and Evolution, Knowledge Representation Learning, Knowledge Base Completion</li>
								<li><b>Knowledge Graph Construction and Knowledge Integration:</b>
									Entity/Event Extraction, Complex Knowledge (Events, Rules, Processes) Acquisition, Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph Construction, Ontology Matching and Entity Alignment</li>
								<li><b>Graph Database and Knowledge Management:</b>
									Architecture Design of Graph Databases, Graph Query Languages, Graph Database Indexing Technologies, and the Application of Graph Database in Knowledge Management</li>
								<li><b>Machine Learning on Graphs:</b>
									Design and Applications of Graph Machine Learning Models, and Research on Representation Learning, Graph Classification, Graph Clustering, and Graph Generation of Graph Data</li>
								<li><b>Knowledge Retrieval and Information Retrieval:</b>
									Knowledge Graph based Information Retrieval, Graph Structured Data based Information Retrieval, Cross-Modal Information Retrieval, and Knowledge Graph Inference in Information Retrieval</li>
								<li><b>Knowledge Graph and Large Language Model Applications:</b>
									Semantic Search, Question Answering and Dialogue, Recommendation System and Decision Support, Industrial/Government Applications</li>
								<li><b>Knowledge Graph Open Resources:</b>
									Domain Knowledge Graph, Evaluation Methods and Datasets, Knowledge Graph Visualization Tools</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Differentiation From the Other Tracks</b><br>
							We strongly recommend that prospective authors carefully check the calls of the other tracks of the conference in order to identify 
							the optimal track for their submission (submission of the same work to multiple tracks is prohibited). 
							Papers that propose new algorithms and architectures should be submitted to the Research track. 
							Papers that describe and/or assess the use or application of Knowledge Graph technologies in practical settings 
							should be submitted to the In-Use track. 
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Review Criteria</b><br>
							Reviews for the In-Use track will be <a href="https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter" target="_blank">single anonymous</a>, 
							i.e., authors are named, reviewers are anonymous.
							Submissions will be assessed in terms of novelty and significance (of the proposed use case or solution), 
							uptake by the target user group, demonstrated or potential impact, as well as overall soundness and quality. 
							Therefore, authors should clearly address these aspects in their submission.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Submission Instructions</b><br>
							The manuscript template is as follows: <br>
							Submission Template: Springer 15 pages<br>
							All submissions should be made via the EasyChair system <br>
						All research submissions must be in English, no longer than 15 pages, in PDF format.
						IJCKG will not accept papers that, at the time of submission, are under review for or have already been published or accepted for
						publication in a journal, another conference, or another IJCKG track. The conference organizers may share information on submissions
						with other venues to ensure that this rule is not violated.<br>

						At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Important Dates: </b>
							<ul>
								<li>Full Paper Submission: June 16, 2025 (11:59 PM AoE)</li>
								<li>Notification of Acceptance: July 15, 2025</li>
