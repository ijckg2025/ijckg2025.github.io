						<p>
							<b>Abstract</b>
							<br>
							Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are emerging as powerful tools for cultural heritage 
							(CH) applications, offering a structured and interconnected way to represent 
							vast and diverse information about artifacts, historical events, creators, 
							and more. As KGs transform disparate, siloed, CH artifacts into a rich, 
							navigable web of entities and relationships, allow at the same time for more 
							intelligent search, discovery, and analysis, moving beyond keyword matching to understanding the 
							underlying meaning and connections within CH collections. KGs facilitate the integration of 
							heterogeneous sources of cultural data, from museum inventories and archival documents to 
							archaeological findings and expert annotations, creating a unified knowledge base that can 
							support various user groups, including researchers, curators, and the general public.
							<br>
							Despite previous and ongoing research work in the use of KGs in CH there are still significant 
							research challenges, as CH research encompasses a multitude of disciplines from the humanities 
							and social sciences (e.g. archaeology, cultural anthropology, history and art history), 
							to natural sciences (e.g. biology, chemistry, physics) and exact sciences (e.g. mathematics, 
							computer and data sciences), each with their own distinct methodologies and workflows. 
							The first important one stems from the <b>heterogeneity and fragmentation of data</b>. 
							CH data is notoriously diverse in format, quality, and granularity, ranging from structured 
							databases to unstructured texts and multimedia. Integrating this disparate information into a 
							coherent graph requires robust methodologies for data harmonization, entity resolution, and 
							schema alignment. Another challenge is the <b>inherent ambiguity and subjectivity within CH knowledge</b>. 
							Historical interpretations can vary, and provenance information is often incomplete or uncertain. 
							KGs need to be able to represent and manage this uncertainty, perhaps through probabilistic 
							links or by incorporating multiple perspectives. Furthermore, <b>scalability and maintainability</b> 
							are crucial concerns. And as usual <b>user interaction and visualization</b> remain active research areas.
							Especially, the ability to add query-to-text interfaces through various AI LLMs emerges as an 
							important aspect for the uptake of the use of KGs in CH applications.
							<br>
							But integrating AI with KGs introduces further complexities. 
							A key concern is <b>bias amplification</b>: as AI models get trained on historical data, 
							they can perpetuate societal biases, leading to skewed interpretations. 
							This requires careful data curation and explainable AI (XAI) solutions so as to ensure fairness. 
							The <b>interpretability of AI-driven insights</b> is another challenge; "black box" AI systems 
							hinder understanding of their rationale, clashing with CH's emphasis on provenance and human 
							validation. Interesting questions arise on how we can use KGs to tackle these issues of bias 
							and transparency in the CH domain. Extending these questions to tackle issues of AI generated 
							CH content or authenticity of CH artifacts, could provide additional roles for the use of 
							cultural KGs.
							<br>
							The workshop aims at exploring problems and solutions in this area and leverage existing 
							efforts in the European and international level like the projects ECHOES (EU) and RICHES (UK) 
							and explore how emerging CH infrastructures can benefit from the advanced use of KGs.

								<li><b>Dimitris Kotzinos</b><br>
								Dimitris Kotzinos is a Full Professor at the Department of Computer Science 
								of the CY Cergy Paris University, member of the ETIS Lab and member of the MIDI team 
								of the lab. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science (in Real-Time Web Information Systems) 
								(2001) and a M.Sc. in Transportation (1996), where he studied networks and their 
								applications in transportation systems. His main research interests include data 
								management algorithms, techniques and tools; development of methodologies, algorithms 
								and tools for web-based information systems, portals and web services; and 
								the understanding of the meaning (semantics) of interoperable data and services on the 
								web. Recently he has started working on studying the formation and evolution of 
								discussions in online social networks using Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial 
								Intelligence (AI) techniques. Additionally, he is working in accountability, 
								explainability and fairness of the ML and AI algorithms, especially when applied 
								in data engineering and analysis problems; this includes issues on data privacy and 
								especially their intersection with the publication of Linked Open Data. 
								Dimitris is participating in ECHOES, a flagship EU-funded project that aims to build 
								the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage. Dimitris has published more 
								than 80 articles in various journals, books, conferences and workshops and serves as 
								a program committee member and reviewer for various conferences and journals. 
								He is also participating in nationally and internationally funded research 
								programs around data analytics, data models and networks and their integration in 
								the everyday life.
								</li>
								<li><b>Sorin Hermon</b><br>
								Sorin Hermon is associate professor at The Cyprus Institute. His research is situated 
								within two converging fields: Digital Cultural Heritage and Heritage Science, developing 
								computer graphics and computer vision-based methods for the shape analysis of artefacts, 
								works of art, archaeological features or buildings in order to characterize their form, 
								materiality, production techniques, technologies of manufacture and their state of 
								conservation, from macro to nano-scale; integrating hyper-spectral and technical imaging 
								data with 3D documentation, and defining formal knowledge representation structures, 
								including domain ontologies, their associated knowledge graphs and related digital 
								repositories. He applies these methodologies on current grant challenges of Cultural 
								Heritage (CH), namely developing sustainable disaster risk and management strategies for 
								reducing the impact of Climate Change on CH, combatting the illicit trafficking of cultural 
								goods and developing open-science workflows for the research-conservation-valorization of CH.  
								Sorin has published more than 120 peer-reviewed research papers, supervised several 
								PhD and MSc students and is director of the MSc program in Digital Cultural Heritage 
								at The Cyprus Institute. He is a member of the Steering Committee of ECHOES, the 
								EU funded project aimed at developing and implementing the European Collaborative 
								Cloud for Cultural Heritage, being responsible, among others, to frame the concept 
								of Heritage Digital Twins as digital commons and to ensure their digital continuum.</li>
